The program will prompt you to enter the values of n and k. It will then calculate and print out the best "near miss" (smallest relative miss) for the given n and k values. The program will find the best x, y, and z that result in the smallest relative miss, as per the instructions given.

This program is designed to systematically search for near misses, so it may take some time to complete depending on the chosen values of n and k. It's important to follow the guidelines and not choose very large values for k, as it may result in excessive computation time or memory usage.
